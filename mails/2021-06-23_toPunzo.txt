subj.: Request to use experimental data

Dear Vincenzo Punzo,

Several years ago, you provided me with car-following data from platoon driving experiments in and around Napoli at a TRB conference. Now, we are about to write a paper on a novel car-following model based on reinforcement learning and would like to use your data for validation purposes.

I kindly ask if we can do this.

All the best,

Martin
